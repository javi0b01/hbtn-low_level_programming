* What is ```main```
* How to print text using ```printf```, ```puts``` and ```putchar```
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator ```sizeof```
* How to compile using ```gcc```
* What is the default program name when compiling with ```gcc```
* What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with ```betty-style```
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
